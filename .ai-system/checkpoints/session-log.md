# Development Checkpoints — Session Log

> **Metadata**
> - last-updated-by: (set on first entry)
> - last-verified-against-code: (set after each session)
> - staleness-policy: append-only — never modify past entries

> **Overview:** Append-only running log of development sessions. Each entry records what was completed, what comes next, and which files were modified. Agents write here at the end of every session so work can be resumed without re-reading the entire codebase. This file is the **append-only historical record** — use `checkpoints/in-progress.md` for current in-progress work.
