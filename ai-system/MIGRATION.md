# Migration Guide: `ai-system` v1 → v2

> For teams or individuals upgrading an existing project that uses the old `ai-system` kit. If you are setting up a new project, ignore this file — just copy the `ai-system-kit/` directory and run `bootstrap-project.md`.

## Upgrade Steps

### For an Existing Project with v1 `ai-system/`

1. **Backup your current `ai-system/`:**

   ```
   Copy-Item -Recurse ai-system ai-system-v1-backup
   ```

2. **Replace the `ai-system/` directory** with the v2 kit:

   ```
   Remove-Item -Recurse ai-system
   Copy-Item -Recurse ai-system-kit\ai-system .
   ```

3. **Migrate your content.** Move over these files from your backup:
   - `.ai-context.md` — your project overview (update the metadata header)
   - `system-architecture.md` — your architecture content (add metadata header)
   - `project-context.md` — your project context (add metadata header)
   - `design-system.md` — your design system (add metadata header)
   - `repair-system.md` — your error entries (add metadata header, ensure entries have status field)
   - `planning/task-queue.md` — add complexity tags to your tasks
   - `planning/project-plan.md` — your feature checklist
   - `index/repo-map.md` — your folder descriptions (mark as auto-regenerable)
   - `index/dependency-graph.md` — your module relationships (mark as auto-regenerable)
   - `memory/` — move your entries, add supersedes fields
   - `checkpoints/session-log.md` — append your log entries
   - `summaries/dev-history.md` — your history entries

4. **Remove old files that no longer exist in v2:**
   - Delete `agents/general-instructions.md` (replaced by `protocols/` + role files)
   - Delete `commands/self-heal.md` (merged into `commands/fix-build.md`)
   - Delete `commands/generate-architecture.md`

5. **Remove vendor config from the project root** (if you copied them in originally):
   - `continue-config.yaml`
   - `start-ai-dev.bat`

6. **Update your README** to reference the new system structure (see the kit's root README for reference).

7. **Run `sync-context.md`** to update freshness metadata on all migrated files.

### Key Behaviour Changes to Note

- **Session start is different.** In v1, agents read `general-instructions.md` first. In v2, they read `protocols/entry-protocol.md` which directs them to use the tiering protocol.
- **Roles are function-based.** Agents must now self-identify which role they are acting in (Planner, Architect, Implementer, etc.) based on the task, not based on which tool they are running in.
- **Quality gate is mandatory.** Before marking any work complete, run the QA checklist (now 9 criteria, not 8 — "Pattern Adherence" was added in v2.1). The old "self-heal on test failure" model is replaced by "verify before declaring done."
- **Interruption recovery.** If a session is interrupted, the next session must run `resume-session.md` before anything else.
- **Commands have contracts.** Every command file now has a header declaring its guarantees, limitations, and required inputs.
